=== v1.0.0rc1 (2015-09-14) =========

- fix issue with annoying warnings about parentheses from new version of the
  Catch framework introduced in previous release

- improve examples in .be/config.mk file


=== v1.0.0rc0 (2015-09-13) =========

- add official support for 32-bit / 64-bit Cygwin platform

- add posibility to define platform / session / source file specific
  compilation flags, see .be/config.mk and src/project.cpp files for usage
  example

- let astyle also indent preprocessor directives in source files

- add new global target ALL that makes really everything, the primary all
  target now recurses just into the build/ directory because this is what is
  needed in 90% of cases

- enable automatic launching of unit tests, now launching doesn't have to be
  requested again

- allow standalone tests to consist of more than one source file, usage is
  following - test_example.cpp should contain main() function, files
  test_example-something.cpp and test_example-anything.cpp are separate but
  related compilation units and therefore they are all compiled into a single
  executable named test_example

- upgrade Catch unit test framework to v1.2.1

- allow numbers in unit and standalone test file names

- refactor and clean up whole build enviroment code base - use better code
  style, improve naming and indentation rules, use target specific variables
  and separate code into functions and shared targets, prettify a lot of
  various paths passed to compiler and other tools to make their output more
  readable, add unit tests for build environment itself, ...

- change doc/ directory Makefile to be more general (should allow to add
  support for e.g. man pages one day)


=== v0.4.0 (2015-08-28) =========

- allow to add file specific CXXFLAGS via code commentary, see the project.cpp
  file for example usage, could be handy for SIMD programming (e.g. runtime CPU
  dispatching)

- add useful include/ directory with symlink to src/, should help with better
  handling of #include directives

- prepare .gitmodules file intended for submodules in lib/ directory

- fix solving dependencies from dependency files when some dependency record
  has been intentionally removed

- fix some other minor bugs


=== v0.3.2 (2015-08-20) =========

- add new variable containing path to lib/ directory for easy definition of
  such 3rd party dependencies

- make doxygen to ignore symbols in "detail" namespace or symbols, usually
  macros, containing string "_DETAIL_" in their names


=== v0.3.1 (2015-07-13) =========

- fix adding clean records, it is now possible to add multiple clean records
  at once and everything should be safe, so clean records shouldn't get lost
  as it sometimes happened

- add possibility to add clean records also from recipes, migrate doc/ Makefile
  to use this new feature

- add new variables with some full paths to headers, sources, executables and
  libraries to ease binding any 3rd party functionality to them

- improve build environment documentation


=== v0.3.0 (2015-06-23) =========

- add special config target to easily modify build environment settings

- add concept of clean record files that help to track built files even if the
  corresponding sources files has been already removed


=== v0.2.0 (2015-04-06) =========

- add support for building more than one executable in build/ directory

- add shared targets concept effectively preventing duplicate code

- refactor all code improving its readability and place all build environment
  internals into the .be/ directory

- all build environment settings is now commented and configurable at one
  place in the .be/config.mk file

- force project rebuild on any change of build environment settings

- disable automatic launching of unit tests, now launching has to be requested


=== v0.1.0 (2015-02-21) =========

- first production ready release


=== v0.0.0 (2015-01-19) =========

- first operational but not production ready release
